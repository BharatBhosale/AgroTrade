 In the current agricultural market, farmers depend on offline contacts and word-of-
mouth to find traders.​

 There is no centralized digital platform where farmers can find verified traders based
on  type and location.​

​

Farmers often face:​

 Delayed payments​

 Fraud traders​

 No written or digital proof of transactions​

​

Traders also maintain records in paper registers, which:​

 Get lost or damaged​

 Are difficult to analyze monthly or yearly​

​

 There is no transparency, no rating system, and no transaction history shared between
farmers and traders.
